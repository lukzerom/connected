## _Online platform for EV users_

Dear visitors.
Above you can see my hobby (and showcase for skills) project for electricity exchange between users .

The application was created in 2020, the diploma project of my postgraduate studies in programming. Back then it was written in JavaScript using **MongoDB** , **Express JS**, **Leaflet Map Provider** , **Material UI** and **Geolocation API**. Currently, I decided that I will continue to develop it in new , modern technologies, thus learn new things.

### Upgrade process

Initially, I started rewriting both the Backend and Frontend parts into **Typescript**
Then, as part of the exercise, I got rid of the Redux architecture and the state management was rewritten to the **contexts** and **custom hooks** built into React. This is now done.

Then , I decided to give myself a challenge and moved my application hosting from Heroku to **Google Cloud**. I released the frontend part for Firebase Hosting, while the backend was released using Google App Engine.

### In the near future:

- Addition of e2e tests 🧪
- Image upload support 🖼️
- Creation of CI / CD pipelines using Github Actions 🚰
- Virtual currency - Electrons - based on Blockchain technology 💰

## Cool Features
