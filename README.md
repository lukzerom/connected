## _Online platform for EV users_

Dear visitors.
Above you can see my hobby (and showcase for skills) project for electricity exchange between users .

The application was created in 2020, the diploma project of my postgraduate studies in programming. Back then it was written in JavaScript using **MongoDB** , **Express JS**, **Leaflet Map Provider** , **Material UI** and **Geolocation API**. Currently, I decided that I will continue to develop it in new , modern technologies, thus learn new things.

### Upgrade process

Initially, I started rewriting both the Backend and Frontend parts into **Typescript**
Then, as part of the exercise, I got rid of the Redux architecture and the state management was rewritten to the **contexts** and **custom hooks** built into React. This is now done.

Then , I decided to give myself a challenge and moved my application hosting from Heroku to **Google Cloud**. I released the frontend part for Firebase Hosting, while the backend was released using Google App Engine.

### In the near future:

- Addition of e2e tests üß™
- Image upload support üñºÔ∏è
- Creation of CI / CD pipelines using Github Actions üö∞
- Virtual currency - Electrons - based on Blockchain technology üí∞

## Cool Features

The user can search for the coordinates of his station on the basis of data from the form. It is possible thanks to connecting the form to the Google Geolocation API which returns geographic coordinates on the basis of station details. The user can then adjust the pin's location by dragging it.
